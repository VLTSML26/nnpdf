%Bias-to-variance ratio by experiment.

Summary
-------

The tables and plots displayed in this section will bring additional informations about the $R_\text{bv}$ indicator for single experiments.

### Bias and variance distributions

The following plots contribute to the bias and variance distribution plot contained in the main section of the report.
